# Introduction

This repository is for a Flask app that deliveries the [linkrot](https://github.com/marshalmiller/linkrot/) project.

# Mission

The goal is to make publications more accessible and replicatable. This tool will coincide with research into persistent links and preserving the Internet and Commons at large.
